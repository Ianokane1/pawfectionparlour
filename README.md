# 1. UX

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

For this project I wanted to build something close to home. My girlfriend owns a dog grooming business yet doesn't own a website. All of her bookings are made via social media and she adds all her bookings in manually. I wamted to create a system where that can be done via a website. 

his project will showcase simplicity and ease to making a booking, updating a booking, cancelling a booking, creating a personal profile and updating the same profile.

### Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to allow the user to sign up, sign in/out, create/update a user profile and create/update/delete a booking in a simple and effective process.

### User Goals:
First Time Visitor Goals
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to make a bokking at my chosen date and time.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to view the servcies available, so that I can decide if this groomer is for me.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to get the contact details of the groomer with ease.

Returning Visitor Goals
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to update my booking details.
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to cancel a booking I have already made.
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to edit my profile for any future bookings.

### User Expectations:
The system should have a simple user interface, with the navigation to each section clear and concise.

-   The servcies page is clear to read.
-   The user interface is easy to navigate.
-   The website is responsive on all devices.
-   To have the ability to contact the groomer for any enquiries.

### User Stories
Throughout the project I used the GitHub projects board to log all user stories as my project management tool. This helped me keep focus on the necesarry tasks as I would move them to the "in progress lane" as I'm working on the story. I would then move them to the "done" lane once the story has been completed.
